**Shiro**

Shiro is a minimalist, privacy-first journaling companion designed to help you record, reflect, and understand your inner world. Powered by advanced AI, it transforms writing into calm, meaningful self-conversation - never noisy, never intrusive.

**Key Features**

- **Private by Design**: All entries - text, voice, and images - are AES-encrypted and stored locally or securely in the cloud. Your thoughts remain yours alone; even the developers can't read them.

- **AI Reflection**: Shiro gently helps you unpack your thoughts with mindful prompts, emotional insights, and guided reflections that evolve with your writing style.

- **Multimodal Journaling**: Capture your day in any form - type, talk, or drop a photo. Shiro understands each mode and links them into a unified timeline.

- **Custom Modes**: Switch between "Easy Chat" for casual notes or "Reflective Mode" for deeper self-discovery.

same app ui frontend, everyone can use.
